## Installation fast
If you want to start writing tests as fast as possible, here are the commands
you'll need to execute:
```bash
npm init --yes # To create a basic package.json
npm install testcafe-cucumber-steps @cucumber/cucumber testcafe gherkin-testcafe --save-dev # To install dependencies and save them to package.json
node node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/utils/prepare.js # To create basic test and Page Object files
```

Then just see the [list of predefined steps](#list-of-predefined-steps) and
start writing tests (in `tests/*.feature`) and adding Page Objects
(in `tests/page-model/*.js`).

Run the tests with:
```bash
node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe chrome,firefox
```

> Note: all [TestCafe CLI options](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/command-line-interface.html)
> are supported.

![Install testcafe-cucumber-steps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marketionist/testcafe-cucumber-steps/master/media/testcafe-cucumber-steps-installation.gif)

## Installation detailed
> Note: this package is lightweight and has only 3 peerDependencies - it uses:
> - [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) to parse step definitions
> - [testcafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe) to execute steps
> - [gherkin-testcafe](https://github.com/Arthy000/gherkin-testcafe) to connect TestCafe with Cucumber

First of all you will need to create `package.json` if you do not have one in
the root folder of your project:
```bash
npm init --yes
```

To install the testcafe-cucumber-steps package and its peerDependencies and to
save it to your `package.json` just run:

```bash
npm install testcafe-cucumber-steps @cucumber/cucumber testcafe gherkin-testcafe --save-dev # In case if you want to use Cucumber 7 (the recent one)
```
OR
```bash
npm install testcafe-cucumber-steps cucumber@6.0.5 testcafe gherkin-testcafe@2.5.1 --save-dev # In case if you want to use Cucumber 6
```
OR
```bash
npm install testcafe-cucumber-steps cucumber@5.1.0 testcafe gherkin-testcafe@2.5.1 --save-dev # In case if you want to use Cucumber 5
```

If you also want to have pre-created config (`.testcaferc.json`) and example
test files (`tests/test-example.feature`, `tests/page-model/test-page-example.js`) -
run additionally:
```bash
node node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/utils/prepare.js
```

## Writing tests
To give a short example of how you can write the tests - here is 
`test-main-page.feature` feature file:
```gherkin
# tests/test-main-page.feature

Feature: My portal main page tests
  As a user of My portal
  I should be able to use main page
  to log in

  Scenario: Open the main page, page title should be present
    Given user goes to URL "http://myportal.test/login.html"
    Then the title should be "Test1 main page"

  Scenario: Products link should lead to Products page
    Given user goes to pageMain from main-page
    When user clicks linkProducts from main-page
    Then URL should contain "/products"
    And the title should contain "Test1 Products"

  Scenario: Log in, link with username and status should be present
    Given user goes to pageMain from main-page
    When user types "mytestuser" in inputLogin from main-page
    And user types "mytestpassword" in inputPassword from main-page
    And user clicks buttonLogin from main-page
    Then linkUsernameLoggedIn from main-page should be present
```

And the Page Object file for this tests will look like this:
```javascript
// tests/page-model/main-page.js

let mainPage = {

    pageMain: 'http://myportal.test/login.html',
    linkProducts: '.link-products',
    inputLogin: '#login',
    inputPassword: '#pass',
    buttonLogin: '.btn-login',
    linkUsernameLoggedIn: 'a.username-authorized'

};

module.exports = mainPage;
```

If you want the Page Objects to look even shorter - you can write the same tests
like this:
```gherkin
# tests/test-main-page.feature

Feature: My portal main page tests
  As a user of My portal
  I should be able to use main page
  to log in

  Scenario: Open the main page, page title should be present
    Given user goes to URL "http://myportal.test/login.html"
    Then the title should be "Test1 main page"

  Scenario: Products link should lead to Products page
    Given user goes to "main-page"."pageMain"
    When user clicks "main-page"."linkProducts"
    Then URL should contain "/products"
    And the title should contain "Test1 Products"

  Scenario: Log in, link with username and status should be present
    Given user goes to "main-page"."pageMain"
    When user types "mytestuser" in "main-page"."inputLogin"
    And user types "mytestpassword" in "main-page"."inputPassword"
    And user clicks "main-page"."buttonLogin"
    Then "main-page"."linkUsernameLoggedIn" should be present
```

See more examples of how to use predefined steps in
[`test1-user.feature`](https://github.com/Marketionist/testcafe-cucumber-steps/blob/master/tests/test1-user.feature) and
[`test2-user.feature`](https://github.com/Marketionist/testcafe-cucumber-steps/blob/master/tests/test2-user.feature).

## Importing and running in CLI
To get access to all Cucumber steps defined in this package just specify the
path to this package when launching tests:
```bash
node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe chrome,firefox node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js tests/**/*.js tests/**/*.feature
```

If you store your Page Objects not in `tests/page-model` folder, then
`PO_FOLDER_PATH` environment variable has to be specified to show the path to
your Page Objects folder:
```bash
PO_FOLDER_PATH='tests/my-custom-page-objects' node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe chrome,firefox node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js tests/**/*.js tests/**/*.feature
```

> Note: you can specify multiple Page Object folders by separating them with commas:
> `PO_FOLDER_PATH='main/my-custom1,login/my-custom2,auth,create/my-custom3'`

Also you can just add `test-e2e` command to `scripts` in `package.json`:
```json
"test-e2e": "PO_FOLDER_PATH='tests/my-custom-page-objects' node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe 'chrome:headless' node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js tests/**/*.js tests/**/*.feature"
```
and then launch tests with:
```
npm run test-e2e
```

> Note: all [TestCafe CLI options](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/command-line-interface.html)
> are supported.

Additionally, you can specify:

- tags to run:
    ```bash
    node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe chrome,firefox node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js tests/**/*.js tests/**/*.feature --tags @fast
    ```

    When using more than one tag, the list needs to be comma separated:
    ```bash
    node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe chrome node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js tests/**/*.js tests/**/*.feature --tags @fast,@long
    ```

    Negation of a tag (via `~`) is also possible (to run all scenarios that have
    tag `fast`, but not `long`):
    ```bash
    node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe chrome node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js tests/**/*.js tests/**/*.feature --tags @fast,~@long
    ```

- custom parameter types:
    ```bash
    node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe chrome node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js tests/**/*.js tests/**/*.feature --param-type-registry-file ./a-file-that-exports-a-parameter-type-registry.js
    ```

    > Note: see Cucumber Expressions in
    > [gherkin-testcafe](https://github.com/kiwigrid/gherkin-testcafe#cucumber-expressions)
    > and Custom Parameter types in
    > [cucumber.io](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/cucumber-expressions/#custom-parameter-types).

## Importing and running with config file
To make life easier and not to specify all options in CLI command, a
`.testcaferc.json` configuration file can be created in the root directory of
your project to store all settings (pathes to all step definitions and tests
should be specified inside the array in `src`):
```json
{
    "browsers": "chrome",
    "src": ["node_modules/testcafe-cucumber-steps/index.js", "tests/**/*.js", "tests/**/*.feature"],
    "screenshots": {
        "path": "tests/screenshots/",
        "takeOnFails": true,
        "pathPattern": "${DATE}_${TIME}/test-${TEST_INDEX}/${USERAGENT}/${FILE_INDEX}.png"
    },
    "quarantineMode": false,
    "stopOnFirstFail": true,
    "skipJsErrors": true,
    "skipUncaughtErrors": true,
    "concurrency": 1,
    "selectorTimeout": 3000,
    "assertionTimeout": 1000,
    "pageLoadTimeout": 1000,
    "disablePageCaching": true
}
```
and then launch tests with:
```bash
node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe
```
or if you use custom Page Objects folder:
```bash
PO_FOLDER_PATH='tests/my-custom-page-objects' node_modules/.bin/gherkin-testcafe
```

All options that are specified in CLI command will override settings from `.testcaferc.json`.

> Note: for all possible settings see:
> - [TestCafe configuration file description](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/configuration-file.html) and
> [example of .testcaferc.json](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe/blob/master/examples/.testcaferc.json)
> - [TestCafe command line options](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/using-testcafe/command-line-interface.html)

## Bonus feature: use XPath selectors in TestCafe
As you know TestCafe does not support XPath selectors out of the box. But now
you can use them in TestCafe Cucumber steps - just write XPath selector in
a Page Object file the same way as you do with CSS selectors - see the example
in [`test1-page.js`](https://github.com/Marketionist/testcafe-cucumber-steps/blob/master/tests/page-model/test1-page.js).
It can also be used in your custom Cucumber steps - for example:
```javascript
const SelectorXPath = require('testcafe-cucumber-steps/utils/selector-xpath.js');

const buttonStartTest = SelectorXPath('//*[ancestor::*[@class="test-panel"] and contains(text(), "Start test")]');
```
